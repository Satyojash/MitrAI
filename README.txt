Hi! We didn't expect you to see you here, anyways, open command prompt and navigate to the directory by using the "cd". Afterwards, please bash "pip install -r requirements.txt" after installing python (duhhh..) andd...you're pretty much good to go, just run the python file.
Besides from that, we, the developers of Pheonix would like to express out warm gratitude to you. Both of us are highschoolers at this piont, and we gave it a fair shot, please send constructive feedback if you see potential.
HAVE A GREAT DAY
